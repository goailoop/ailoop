    "Enhanced channel validation module with IF-018 interface implementation",
    "Added validate_channel_name_if018() function matching IF-018 interface contract (returns ChannelValidationResult with valid boolean and optional error_message)",
    "Updated module documentation to reflect COMP-007 component ownership and IF-018 interface",
    "Added tests for IF-018 interface contract compliance (idempotency, consistency)",
    "Maintained existing validate_channel_name() function as helper for backward compatibility",
    "Validation rules ensure identical behavior in both direct and server modes (REQ-020, REQ-033)"
