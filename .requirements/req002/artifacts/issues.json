      "question": "REQ-013 has both WHEN trigger and IF condition in the response. Should this be: a) split into two requirements (one for waiting, one for timeout handling), b) restructured as complex EARS type with proper WHEN/IF syntax, or c) keep as-is with clarified wording?",
      "status": "resolved",
      "resolution": "REQ-013 simplified to focus on waiting behavior only. Timeout error handling is already covered by REQ-018, so removed redundant timeout error handling from REQ-013 statement."

      "suggested_fix": "REQ-015 mentions 'same physical WebSocket connection' but user clarified that each CLI command creates its own connection. This requirement may be unnecessary or needs clarification about when multiple requests would come from same connection.",
      "question": "REQ-015 assumes multiple requests from same connection, but you said each CLI command creates its own connection. Should we: a) remove REQ-015 as unnecessary (each command = one connection = one request), b) clarify that this applies to future connection reuse scenarios, or c) specify that this handles edge cases where connection is reused?",
